# Firecloud GraphQl

## GraphQL Server

To install: 
`` $ pip install firecloud flask graphene>=2.0.0 flask-graphql flask-cors``

* Also [firecloud-tools](https://github.com/broadinstitute/firecloud-tools) are required for the Firecloud API queries.

To run:
`` $ python server.py ``

The file named `schema.graphql` contains the current schema (implemented in the module of the same name). Use the data utility script in the Portal UI repository to update this schema when needed.

## External API Utilities

The server will load data from a local database. This database is created by running a utility script which queries the Firecloud and BigQuery APIs.

### Run 

The script that loads the local database with data from the Firecloud workspaces and BigQuery database is run as follows. Before running the script first set up the environment for the external API calls.

[TBD]

### Firecloud API

#### Installation 

A registered service account must be set up prior to using the Firecloud API script. 

Follow these steps to set up an account registered with Firecloud:

1. In Google Cloud go to IAM -> Service accounts (and create a new service account or use the existing compute if running on a VM) and create a key.
2. Download this key to the machine you will run the Firecloud API script.
3. Install firecloud-tools and run the following command (replacing $PATH_TO_KEY and $EMAIL with specific values)
```
$ ./run.sh scripts/register_service_account/register_service_account.py -j $PATH_TO_KEY -e $EMAIL
```
4. Set the environment variable to point to the KEY
```
$ export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$PATH_TO_KEY
```
5. Login to the account (if not using a compute engine service account on a VM) with `gsutil config`
6. Add the service account to each Firecloud workspace it will need to query. This can be done by adding the service account email id to the "Share" page as a new "User ID" with READER level access (no share and no compute permissions).

When running the Firecloud API script make sure the environment variable is set and firecloud-tools, plus all of its dependencies are installed.

### BigQuery API

#### Installation

To install the client library run

``pip install --upgrade google-cloud-bigquery``

To set up authentication

-In the Google Console of your project create service account
-Download generated json file that contains your credentials key
-Either set path to your credentials file as environmental variable

 ``export GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=$PATH_TO_KEY``
  
  or pass path directly when defining client within code
  
 ``from google.cloud import bigquery``
 ``client = bigquery.Client.from_service_account_json($PATH_TO_KEY)``
